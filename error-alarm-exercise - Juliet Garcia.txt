> Firstable, we can have an event called "logger" that is dispatched each time there is an error in the web application.

> This "logger" event can contain the function called "logError" that receive an argument with the specific error.

> This "logError" function is created to appends the error to the end of a log file.

    > We have to do it in a synchronous method or queue to avoid overlap.

    > This log file is stored and/or updated in a specific place in the file system on the server where is running the web application.

    > The error that is appended in the log file, is registered with a datetime and the error message.

    > In the function, we have to check if there are more than ten errors in the last minute each one minute.

        > We can check this reading the log file and get the last 11 errors registered.

        > With these last 11 errors, we have to check the last one of them to get the datetime of the error.

        > We can get the datetime using some regex expression and compare this datetime with the current datetime in UTC.

        > For other side, we have another event that contain a function that send an email notification.

        > If the condition is true or there are more than ten errors in one minute, we can dispatch the event to send an email notification.

        > Also, we have to check that we have to receive only one email notificacion per minute.

            > To resolve this, we can have a synchronous method or queue that is in charged in prevent to send more one email notification adding a limit of time to it.

1) logger event:

    logError(error) function:

        sync/queue function:

            store/update error(datetimeUtc, errorMsg) function

        get lastLogs(11) function:

            get last errors in the last minute

        get lastOneError(lastErrors) function:

            get lastOne error

            get datetime of the last error in UTC

        get isThereAlarm(datetimeLastError, quantityErrors) function:

            check datetimeLastError and currentDatetime are the same and if there are more than 10 errors

        isThereAlarm is true, dispatch emailNotification event
